												<h2>Let me introduce myself</h2>
												<p>this is where it begins...</p>
											</header>
											<h3>My Story</h3>

											<p>My story begins with me moving to Australia in 2010. From a young age I could sense there was something different about me and my education. 
												Although I tried very hard, I struggled to improve at school or develop as well as I had hoped, and I remember feeling ashamed for not being able to solve problems or answer questions as quickly as other students. 
												Since I grew up and started my schooling in different countries, I was put into ESL/EALD when I moved to Australia despite coming from an English speaking household.
												I later learned that I had dyslexia, which significantly impacted my confidence and learning. However, resulting from this, I discovered that I thrived in creative areas instead. 
												I loved art class in primary school and from a young age have always had the hobby of cooking at home. 
												When I started high school, I realised how competitive it was (especially because I went to a partially selective school), but also noticed how I thrived in the TAS and creative arts subjects, mainly food tech, textiles and art. Blooming in these areas started to boost my confidence in my ability and practical skills and made me less think about my academic ability in the junior years of high school. The aggregate of all these experiences, both positive and negative, considerably influenced my higher education and career choice. </p>

												<span class="image featured"><img src="images/chatswoodPS.jpg" alt="" style="width: min-content;" /></span>
											<h3>My Interest</h3>
											<p> My hobbies consist mainly of baking and cooking. 
												I enjoy every aspect of food, including the science and chemistry behind food nutrition. 
												I really enjoy art/creativity and have noticed that it is a really important element of this degree and for life/teaching in general. 
												(Shown below are pictures of desserts I have made in the past).</p>

											<p>After completing a few units I have begun to have interest within the design and technology units and the coding unit they have offered at ACU. 
												Learning new skills has shown that I have a great ability to pick up new skills and learn them quickly.

											</p>

											<h3>Why TAS teaching?</h3>
											<p>I have always wanted to be a teacher since I was young, 
												because even as a child I wanted to help other people, and as I got older 
												I realised that the best way to do it was by helping educate people. 

												In high school I really found a passion for food and avidly enjoy anything related to it. 
												Food technology was my favourite subject in high school, so it made sense to me that I teach. </p>
											<p>												
												As a TAS teacher, I believe that we should teach the next generation the skills they need to be successful, independent and lifelong learners. They should be taught by teachers with a passion so that they too become passionate and confident themselves. I am excited to learn, grow, share my knowledge, and contribute to the world of technology education (and show my future students that technology subjects are the best subjects!).
